In <a href=\"https://conservativehome.com/2022/09/28/daniel-hannan-no-the-pound-isnt-crashing-because-of-a-trifling-batch-of-tax-cuts/\">an article for ConservativeHome</a>, he argues that the pound has been tanking since the mini-budget last week not because the markets have lost confidence in the government to manage the public finances, but because they now expect Labour to win the next election. He says:</p> \\n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \\n   <p>What the sterling sell-off may have reflected … is the belief that this budget has made a Labour victory more likely.</p> \\n   <p>For, although the economics were sound, the politics were always going to be difficult. Few voters get the counterintuitive logic of the Laffer Curve. A government might earn more revenue from a 40p than a 45p tax rate; but it will lose votes from those who refuse to believe it. A government might enlarge the economy, and so have more to spend on public services, if it scraps the EU’s limit on bankers’ bonuses.

Liz Truss seems unlikely to take Starmer’s advice, and perform a U-turn, even though that could potentially solve the sterling crisis. Starmer probably realises that having the opposition call for a U-turn makes it, politically, even harder for the government to perform one.</p></li> \\n  </ul> \\n  <ul> \\n   <li><p><strong>He said people would be “worried sick” about their mortgages with the cost of borrowing going up. He told BBC Breakfast.</strong></p></li> \\n  </ul> \\n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \\n   <p>This is a situation where the government has self-inflicted harm on our economy. And people looking at their mortgages, looking at their prices this morning, will be worried sick, I think. I wouldn’t be surprised if they’re not a little bit angry that the government has lost control of the economy.</p> \\n  </blockquote> \\n  <p>Speaking on LBC, he said he spoke to his sister, who is a care worker, last night and she was “really struggling” with bills. He said:</p> \\n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \\n   <p>She’s a care worker. She’s really struggling. She’s just got her bill in, in her case her energy bill, and she’s really struggling. She’s got just a small amount of money left in the bank and she’s in a high state of anxiety. And that’s just an example of what it’s like for many, many people, whether it’s the mortgage, whether it’s prices.</p> \\n  </blockquote> \\n  <ul> \\n   <li><p><strong>He signalled Labour would expect the rich to pay more in tax – although he claimed it was “not really” right to call this a wealth tax. </strong>On LBC <strong>Nick Ferrari</strong> asked if he would ever look at a wealth tax and Starmer, who is normally a very fluent interviewee, hesitated and stuttered briefly as he started to reply. <strong>Starmer</strong> said:</p></li> \\n  </ul> \\n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \\n   <p>We are looking at how we tax fairly. On wealth, I’m looking at whether and how we tax all different forms of income. Some people obviously earn their income through a wage.

       "  'bodyText': 'Rayner turns to Kwasi Kwarteng, the chancellor. To think this was the party that claimed they were for sound money. That’s what one high-flying new Tory MP certainly thought in 2012. He wrote a pamphlet demanding a balanced budget every year. He said: “Fiscal prudence is the very least we should expect from a chancellor.” And if they failed, they should face a 20% pay cut. That Tory MP must be absolutely furious with the new Tory chancellor – except he is the new Tory chancellor. I’ve got a funny feeling he won’t be taking that pay cut either. Pay cuts are for other people. Rayner says Labour has shown it would deliver a more competent government than the Tories. Liz Truss’s government is plunging the country into chaos, she says. Rayner goes on: Tough on crime? They brought crime to Number 10. Defenders of the free market? The market’s in free fall. England’s green and pleasant land? Frack it. From the party of stability to causing earthquakes. From the party of business, to a slap down from the IMF. From the party of serious government to the party of parties. Liz Truss has even crashed the pork market. Now ... that. Is. A. Disgrace. You’d think that snouts in the trough was the one thing they could manage. Rayner is at least the third speaker from the platform to mock Truss’s infamous cheese speech. At the Labour conference Angela Rayner, the deputy leader, is giving the closing speech of the event. She starts by saying that, although she is proud of Labour’s traditions, “there is one part of our history that I will never celebrate - losing elections”. And she says that, although Labour likes to talk about what more it should do, it should celebrate its successes more. She goes on: When the Tories deliver 1% of what they promised, they talk endlessly about that 1% and we never hear about the list of broken promises. When we deliver 99% of what we promised, we talk endlessly about the 1% we didn’t instead. Just think about the historic Labour governments and their legacy. They didn’t please all of our movement all of the time, including me. But those Labour Governments made history. The NHS. Social security. The welfare state. Council housing. Modern higher education. The Open University. Decriminalising homosexuality. Outlawing racial discrimination. Introducing equal pay. The National Minimum Wage. Sure Start. The Good Friday Agreement. Civil Partnerships. The Equality Act. The Human Rights Act. The world’s first Climate Change Act. Conference, if we’re not proud of ourselves, don’t expect anyone else to do it for us. In her speech to the Labour conference Bridget Phillipson, the shadow education secretary, pointed out that the UK government had got through five education secretaries within a year. Gavin Williamson was sacked in the reshuffle on 15 September 2021. He was replaced by Nadhim Zahawi, who was replaced by Michelle Donelan when Zahawi got promoted after Rishi Sunak resigned. Donelan quit within two days, joining the exodus of ministers from Boris Johnson’s government, and she was replaced by James Cleverly on an interim basis before Kit Malthouse got the job properly when Liz Truss formed her government. He was appointed on 6 September. Phillipson said: Education, under this government is like a school maths problem. If you have five education secretaries in one year. Three of them, who haven’t got a clue what they are doing. Two of them, who want a return to the fifties. What have you got left? I’ll tell you. A government that is failing our children. Childcare in crisis. A recovery programme in chaos. School buildings collapsing. A skills system unfit for today, never mind tomorrow. Universities treated as a political battleground, not a public good. The Conservative peer Daniel Hannan has a novel take on the currency crisis. In an article for ConservativeHome, he argues that the pound has been tanking since the mini-budget last week not because the markets have lost confidence in the government to manage the public finances, but because they now expect Labour to win the next election. He says: What the sterling sell-off may have reflected … is the belief that this budget has made a Labour victory more likely. For, although the economics were sound, the politics were always going to be difficult. Few voters get the counterintuitive logic of the Laffer Curve. A government might earn more revenue from a 40p than a 45p tax rate; but it will lose votes from those who refuse to believe it. A government might enlarge the economy, and so have more to spend on public services, if it scraps the EU’s limit on bankers’ bonuses. But the voters who make a logical assessment of their interest will be outnumbered by those want something – anything – done to make bankers’ lives harder. In other words (and I am aware of how much this runs against the current narrative) what we have seen since Friday is partly a market adjustment to the increased probability that Sir Keir Starmer will win in 2024 or 2025 – leading to higher taxes, higher spending, and a weaker economy. The more conventional view is that Labour is soaring in the polls because the economy is tanking, not the other way round. And in her speech to the conference, Rosena Allin-Khan, the shadow minister for mental health, said that the next Labour government would guarantee access to mental health treatment within a month. It would also recruit more mental health staff, establish mental health support in every school and open mental health hubs for under-25s in every community, with no need for referral. She said: Whenever I meet patients and staff, all over the country, people ask me the same thing, “What practical difference will Labour’s pledges make to me?” It’s a good question. Conference, here’s the answer: Our resolute commitment to prevention, early intervention and timely treatment will make the difference. Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, told the Labour conference in his speech this morning that the party would have a 10-year plan for NHS modernisation that would include expanding the workforce, having higher standards for patients and shifting “the focus of healthcare out of the hospital and into the community”. On expanding the workforce, he said: Without a workforce plan, the Conservatives have no plan for the NHS. Everything else they announce is a sticking plaster that fails to address the root cause of the NHS crisis. Politics is about choices. Labour believes the country needs doctors and nurses more than the richest need a tax cut. So, we will double the number of medical training places. And create an extra 10,000 nursing and midwifery clinical placements every year. And on standards he said: When we were in government, Labour guaranteed appointments within two days. Labour will give all patients the ability to book online, the opportunity to self-refer to specialist services where appropriate and a wider range of choice so that we can choose whether we want to see someone face-to-face, on the phone or via a video link. The days of waiting on the phone at 8am to book an appointment with your GP will be over and we will bring back the family doctor. A Labour government would fund breakfast clubs for every primary school in England, paid for by restoring the top rate of income tax to 45p, Bridget Phillipson, the shadow education secretary, has said. My colleague Jessica Elgot has the story here. Here are the main points from Keir Starmer’s morning interview round. Starmer suggested the government should urgently shelve elements of its mini-budget from last Friday in the light of the impact it is having on borrowing costs, and the criticism of it from the IMF. (See 7.36am.) The IMF intervention will be a particular boon for Labour members because when the 1976 Callaghan government having to go “cap in hand to the IMF” for a loan in 1976, that became emblematic of Labour financial incompetence (unfairly, some argue) and that charge severely damaged the party’s reputation for a generation. Liz Truss seems unlikely to take Starmer’s advice, and perform a U-turn, even though that could potentially solve the sterling crisis. Starmer probably realises that having the opposition call for a U-turn makes it, politically, even harder for the government to perform one. He said people would be “worried sick” about their mortgages with the cost of borrowing going up. He told BBC Breakfast. This is a situation where the government has self-inflicted harm on our economy. And people looking at their mortgages, looking at their prices this morning, will be worried sick, I think. I wouldn’t be surprised if they’re not a little bit angry that the government has lost control of the economy. Speaking on LBC, he said he spoke to his sister, who is a care worker, last night and she was “really struggling” with bills. He said: She’s a care worker. She’s really struggling. She’s just got her bill in, in her case her energy bill, and she’s really struggling. She’s got just a small amount of money left in the bank and she’s in a high state of anxiety. And that’s just an example of what it’s like for many, many people, whether it’s the mortgage, whether it’s prices. He signalled Labour would expect the rich to pay more in tax – although he claimed it was “not really” right to call this a wealth tax. On LBC Nick Ferrari asked if he would ever look at a wealth tax and Starmer, who is normally a very fluent interviewee, hesitated and stuttered briefly as he started to reply. Starmer said: We are looking at how we tax fairly. On wealth, I’m looking at whether and how we tax all different forms of income. Some people obviously earn their income through a wage. Other people earn it through stocks and shares and dividends, and we’re looking at what is a fair way to tax all income, wherever it comes from. Asked if people could call that a wealth tax, Starmer replied: No, it’s not really a wealth tax. It’s looking at different forms of income. It’s stocks and shares and dividends. Labour has already committed to re-introducing the 45% top rate of income tax, which the Tories are abolishing. But Starmer is hinting the wealthy might pay more in tax under Labour in other ways too. He said that what Rupa Huq said about Kwasi Kwarteng being “superficially” black was “racist”. But he refused to say she should be thrown out of the party, saying that she was now subject to a disciplinary process that needed to proceed independently. He said that Labour’s plans to generate all electricity from green sources by 2030 would require changes to planning laws. When it was put to him on Radio 5 Live that Labour would not be able to put up enough wind turbines in time under current planning laws, he replied: “Yeah, we’re going to have to change planning regulations.” He said he hoped Labour was now closer to the party of Tony Blair than to the party of Jeremy Corbyn “because because Tony Blair won three elections and I want us to win the next election”. (See 7.44am.) He was unable to say exactly how Labour would fund the cut in the basic rate of income tax to 19%. Labour has said it will match the cut, which the Tories are funding through borrowing. Labour is opposed to unfunded tax cuts. Starmer said the party was still committed to its fiscal rules, which rule out unfunded tax cuts, but Starmer said an incoming Labour administration “will inherit the government’s arrangements”. It would get to the point where it could meet its fiscal rules “as quickly as we can”, he said. Q: As leader of the Labour party, how would you be able to work with Rupa Huq if she were allowed to continue as an MP? Starmer says he has put an independent disciplinary process in place. He will respect that process. But what she said was “racist”. Of course it is frustrating to have to be talking about this story after his speech, he says. But he says the mood at conference is very positive. We are now in a position to look confidently at the electorate and the electorate can look confidently at us. Q: Who should get Eurovision? Liverpool or Glasgow? Starmer says, since he is in Liverpool, he will go for them. And that’s it. The full interview is (we think) over. I will unpack it all a bit more shortly, with a summary and analysis. Q: Do you back pay rises matching inflation for NHS staff? Starmer declares an interest. His wife works for the NHS, he says. He says there is a pay review process under way. But of course he thinks workers need a pay rise. Q: Why does your plan to freeze energy bills only last six months? The government’s lasts two years. Starmer claims the big difference between the government and Labour is that Labour is proposing a windfall tax to part fund this cost. On timing, he says his plan lasts for six months. Of course after six months Labour would need a new plan. Q: How are your plans for Great British Energy costed? Starmer says start-up money will be put in. An independent board will decide how it is spent. It will bring in private investment too. Private companies say, if they knew what the government’s plans were, they would have more confidence investing. Q: How much money would you borrow to set this up? Starmer says Labour would only borrow to invest. The current government is borrowing for day to day spending. Labour would not do that, he says. He says Labour would spend £28bn a year on its entire clean energy strategy. The Great British Energy plan would only use part of that money – £8bn, he says. Keir Starmer is now being interviewed on BBC Breakfast. He starts by repeating his point about the IMF statement being very serious. He knows how worried people will be. This is a situation “where the government has self-inflicted harm on our economy”. People will be “worried sick” about their mortgages, and angry with the government, he says. Q: Alastair Campbell told the programme yesterday that sometimes you lack oomph. Starmer says he is a serious person. He has done important jobs. In every past job he has done, like being DPP, he has seen problems and fixed them. Q: Lucy Powell was asked what the most exciting thing you had done was, and could not reply. Starmer says for him the most exciting thing he has done was see the birth of his children. He suggests that if he came on the programme to say he had done a bungee jump, that would not make him a better PM. If I came on here and said I’ve done a bungee jump you wouldn’t say, ‘Well, great, now we’ve got the prime minister we need’. And interview is over. It’s BBC Breakfast next. Q: Can you really be the party of the centre ground if you have an MP making comments like Rupa Huq’s? Starmer says what Huq said was racist. The party took action. But the party is confident. Q: Can someone stay in the Labour party if they say things that are racist. Starmer says there will be an independent process. Q: But you are leader. Starmer says it is right to have an independent process. Q: When would you get debt falling as a proprotion of GDP? Starmer says Labour does want to get that down. Q: The IMF says, unless you can commit to tax rises, the credibility of its fiscal rules could be called into question. Starmer says that is why Labour is rejecting some of the government’s tax cuts, and proposing a windfall tax. Q: How would you help people with their mortgages? Starmer says the single most important thing is to get the economy under control. The markets do not have confidence in what the government is doing. Q: The markets do not like unfunded tax cuts. But you are proposing some too, like cutting the basic rate to 19%. Starmer says all Labour’s tax plans have been funded. It will inherit “a complete mess”. But it will stick to its fiscal rules. Q: How much will it cost cutting the basic rate of income tax, and how will you fund that? Starmer says Labour will set out its plans. Going ahead with the corporation tax increase would raise about £18bn. Q: But Rachel Reeves said on Monday that you would have to borrow to fund some of these tax cuts. Starmer says Labour would inherit a situation were tax cuts were being funded by borrowing. But as quickly as possible it will get back to its fiscal rules, he says. Martha Kearney is now interviewing Keir Starmer on the Today programme. Q: In the 1970s Labour had to go to the IMF. What do you make of the IMF statement about the mini-budget? Starmer says a move like this is rare. He goes on: I think it reflects the fact that the government has completely lost control of the economy. Q: John Redwood told us the IMF did not see inflation coming? Starmer says, instead of disparaging the IMF, Tories should be telling people how they are going to solve the problems people face with their mortages. He repeats his call for the government to urgently shelve the mini-budget plans. (See 7.36am.) Q: Should the Bank of England be doing more? Starmer says the Bank is independent. It is not for him to tell it what to do. But the government needs to review what it announced on Friday. On Radio 5 Live they play clips of interviews with voters discussing Keir Starmer. Most of them are relatively negative about him personally. Asked for his reaction, Starmer says Labour had a 17-point lead in a poll yesterday. He says the party is confident. Q: Do you stand for democracy? Of course, says Starmer. Q: So why are you ignoring the vote for PR? Starmer says, in Labour, the manifesto-making process is separate from conference. Q: Should Rupa Huq continue as an MP? Starmer says there will be an independent process. But what she said was racist. Q: Why won’t you let shadow ministers join picket lines? Starmer replies: I completely empathise with people who are struggling to pay their bills, I support industrial action, trade unions have to do their job representing their members. Whatever the disruptions of a strike - and there are disruptions and I don’t want them to go ahead - equally they are last resort and people who are striking are losing money themselves by going on strike. I want to see that resolved, but the single most important thing that I can do and that every Labour politician can do for working people is to have a Labour government that can get to grips with the underlying problem of the cost-of-living crisis and put in place much better employment rights for those who are struggling so hard. Q: Your plan to freeze energy bills only last six months? What happens next? Starmer says Labour has been the first to put proposals on the table all along, as with the windfall tax, and the energy price freeze. In April they will have to look at this again. Every time there has been a problem, Labour has put a plan on the table, the government has said it’s wrong, but it has then implemented the Labour plan. It’s Radio 5 Live next, and the first question to Keir Starmer is whether it is really possible to generate all electricity from renewable sources by 2030. Starmer says this is “tough, but doable”. The pledge refers to electricity generation from renewable source, he says, not all energy generation. He is not talking about phasing out gas by 2030. He says the plan has been properly assessed by independent analysts. To implement this, and get wind farms built quickly, planning regulations will have to change, he says. Q: Was it a mistake to campaign for Jeremy Corbyn to be prime minister? Starmer says he does not regret serving in the last shadow cabinet. But he always said the party had to change, he says. Q: What was your reaction to what Rupa Huq said about Kwasi Kwarteng? Starmer says what she said was wrong and “racist”. He is very pleased the Labour party acted. An independent process will now consider what happens next. Q: You want to be seen as economically responsible. But what is your position on government borrowing, and how are you different from the Conservatives? Starmer says Labour has two rules: it will pay for day to day spending, and borrow to invest. It would not cut the top rate of tax. It would not cancel the corporation tax rise. It would impose a windfall tax on energy companies. And it would end non-dom status. Q: Is Labour closer to the party of Tony Blair than the party of Jeremy Corbyn? Starmer says: I certainly hope so, because Tony Blair won three elections and I want us to win the next election. In the past, when asked questions like this, Starmer tend to avoid making a choice, stressing that he was different from both Blair and Corbyn. Keir Starmer is now being interviewed on Times Radio. He says there is a mood at Labour conference they have not seen for years. People are confident. They feel that it is time for change. Q: How much will it cost to set up your Great British Energy company? Starmer says the biggest offshore windfarm in Wales is owned by Sweden. Other foreign countries are investing in the UK energy market. The new company will be there to provide clean energy, and energy security. And the rewards will come to the UK. Q: But is there money to fund it? The latest wind and power projects cost £18bn. Your budget for this is £2bn, which does not seem enough? Starmer says renewable energy is now nine times cheaper than gas. And the new company is there to stimulate private investment. The board will be independent. Good morning. Keir Starmer’s speech to Labour delegates was widely praised yesterday, but he must be the first opposition leader in many years whose conference speech has, in effect, received an endorsement from the IMF. In his speech, Starmer said: The government has lost control of the British economy – and for what? They’ve crashed the pound – and for what? Higher interest rates. Higher inflation. Higher borrowing. And for what? Not for you. Not for working people. For tax cuts for the richest 1% in our society. Don’t forget. Don’t forgive. The IMF did not put it quite like that, but in an extraordinary statement last night it said something broadly similar – criticising the tax cuts (“we do not recommend large and untargeted fiscal packages at this juncture”) and calling for a rethink. Starmer is doing a round of interviews this morning. Speaking to Nick Ferrari on LBC, Starmer said that, in the light of the IMF warnings, the government should urgently review the plans it set out in its mini-budget. He said: The IMF statement is very serious, and it shows just what a mess the government have made of the economy. And it is self-inflicted. This was a step they didn’t have to take … We all look at the graph and we see the pound falling, but it’s not an abstract graph; this is reflected in people’s mortgages etc and people are very, very worried this morning. Some people who thought they had a mortgage arrangement last week now haven’t got one. Imagine that, a first-time buyer, suddenly your dream goes up. This government has got to respond to this. They’ve got to set out, in terms, how are they going to fix the problems that they have made. At the moment they are saying they might be doing something in November. That’s far too long. They’ve got to review the plans they put out on Friday. They’ve got to do it urgently, in my view. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.55am: Conference opens with a session including speeches from Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, Rosena Allin-Khan, the shadow minister for mental health, and Bridget Phillipson, the shadow education secretary. 11.30am: The Belarus opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya addresses the conference. 11.45am: Angela Rayner, the deputy Labour leader, speaks as the conference concludes. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can’t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter. I’m on @AndrewSparrow. Alternatively, you can email me at andrew.sparrow@theguardian.com',\n",
